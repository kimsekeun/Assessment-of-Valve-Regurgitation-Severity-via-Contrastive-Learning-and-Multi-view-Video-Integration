> Overall architecture of the proposed method. A supervised contrastive learning to learn representations using a contrastive loss but uses label information to sample positives and negative pairs. A feature extractor which employs a pre-trained encoder shared across all input video. The optimization step involves the use of inter-intra contrastive loss in conjunction with classification loss.
